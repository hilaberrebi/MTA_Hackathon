# mta-hack-project
Starter kit for the MTA hackathon
## Overview
This repository ended up being the branch that we managed the hackathon development.
We started up aiming to learn some react.js while the entire dev team had never done any front-end work before, use
of Material UI was also added in later.
You can see the product of our labor here, just to mention that the our pitch got us to the finals in the hackathon!
## New Frameworks used
* react.js
* Material UI
* git - as a code collaboration tool
* trello as a team managing system

## Getting Started

#### Installations!
1. Install node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Install git from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
3. If you don't have a github user please create one and ask for an invite to collaborate.
4. Open a console and see that it worked correctly by running:
* `git version`
* `node --version`
* `npm --version`

#### Setting up a react environment

1. [Clone this git repository](https://github.com/omrisk/mta-hack-project.git)
2. Open the folder in the IDE/editor of your choice
3. Open a console in the src dir and run `npm install`
4. After the dependencies install run `npm start` and you should get a localhost running a "Hello World!" landing page
